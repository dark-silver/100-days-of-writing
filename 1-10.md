### 1 - 2023-11-10

Hi,

They say that the first five and last five pages of a book are what an author should spend most of their focus on, the rest remaining unread by the reader. Well, I hope that any future reader of this series of works doesn't keep their hopes too high for the qualty of this series of ramblings, since I'm not being very intentional with my words.

Onto the meat of the matter (is this still alright to say in 2023?), I'm penning down (read: typing) this series of texts because it seemed fun at when my friend [Aayush](https://github.com/AayushKucheria) suggested it. We shall see if it remains fun XD. 

I have roughly an hour and a quarter left in the day, and I'm doing this because I thankfully remembered it a few hours ago. It would be sad to mess up the first day of building a habit, ey? (And also lose a bet on the first day of a hundred. Bad sportsmanship, even.)

I've been very lucky in life, never having to have seriously worried about my next meal or the permanency of the roof over my head. It's something I think about with some regularity. However, being grateful is difficult for me. Not because there isn't a lot to be grateful for, but because for me, emotions are like a thin soup. The flavour is experienced for a moment or three, and then promptly disappears.

Nothing like a rich, velvety, thick gravy that coats the tongue, and even upon being swallowed, can be tasted long after the completion of the meal. The events of "stickiness" of emotion are few and far between. Not that I remember those either, I have an appallingly short memory for nearly everything. Somehow, someway, I have grown into a functioning adult in society.

Still, this is nothing to feel sorry for. I'm perfectly content as I am, with respect to my internal state. Although, I could be putting in much greater effort towards my academic success. The downside of being such a present-focused person is that I cannot for the life of me look at the long-term consequences of an action at some moment. And so it is trivial for a new input to derail me from my fragile, tentative daily schedule. **Especially** since I find nearly everything about the world interesting, so stopping to listen to a new tidbit here and there *never* feels like a chore.

It has just come to mind that this is excellent training for a managerial role, since if I can guide myself towards an outcome within expected parameters, I can probably do that with most people.

Nevertheless, as a manager of one, I make do with the easily distracted employee that is myself. And I'm a pretty alright guy to work with, I think.

Signing off,
Rajat
