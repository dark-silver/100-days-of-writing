Hi,

They say that the first five and last five pages of a book are what an author should spend most of their focus on, the rest remaining unread by the reader. Well, I hope that any future reader of this series of works doesn't keep their hopes too high for the qualty of this series of ramblings, since I'm not being very intentional with my words.

Onto the meat of the matter (is this still alright to say in 2023?), I'm penning down (read: typing) this series of texts because it seemed fun at when my friend [Aayush](https://github.com/AayushKucheria) suggested it. We shall see if it remains fun XD. 

I have roughly an hour and a quarter left in the day, and I'm doing this because I thankfully remembered it a few hours ago. It would be sad to mess up the first day of building a habit, ey? (And also lose a bet on the first day of a hundred. Bad sportsmanship, even.)

I've been very lucky in life, never having to have seriously worried about my next meal or the permanency of the roof over my head. It's something I think about with some regularity. However, being grateful is difficult for me. Not because there isn't a lot to be grateful for, but because for me, emotions are like a thin soup. The flavour is experienced for a moment or three, and then promptly disappears.

Nothing like a rich, velvety, thick gravy that coats the tongue, and even upon being swallowed, can be tasted long after the completion of the meal. The events of "stickiness" of emotion are few and far between. Not that I remember those either, I have an appallingly short memory for nearly everything. Somehow, someway, I have grown into a functioning adult in society.

Still, this is nothing to feel sorry for. I'm perfectly content as I am, with respect to my internal state. Although, I could be putting in much greater effort towards my academic success. The downside of being such a present-focused person is that I cannot for the life of me look at the long-term consequences of an action at some moment. And so it is trivial for a new input to derail me from my [fragile](#fragile-daily-schedule), tentative daily schedule. **Especially** since I find nearly everything about the world interesting, so stopping to listen to a new tidbit here and there *never* feels like a chore.

It has just come to mind that this is excellent training for a managerial role, since if I can guide myself towards an outcome within expected parameters, I can probably do that with most people.

Nevertheless, as a manager of one, I make do with the easily distracted employee that is myself. And I'm a pretty alright guy to work with, I think.

Hi,

It is 2304 hrs as I type this, which is typical behaviour for Rajat (for the uninformed, my name is Rajat.) Another thing typical for me is that a task spends some time in my mind before I get around to doing it. So generally, I have thought out at least the first few steps of completing a task; be it a programming assignment; ideas for an essay; or the itinerary for an event.

But, I wonder if that is the right way to go about it?

What was even the purpose of agreeing to do this challenge? And maybe a more significant consideration is why did it take two days for me to finally think about this?

With regards to the purpose, I had recently been feeling as if I should practice my writing skills. So this was an opportune moment to grasp that. But I have planned absolutely nothing for this challenge. Which isn't good, since it is only deliberate practice that yields great benefit, not hastily completed tasks off one's to-do list.

For the latter question, it's a common thing for my absent-minded and present-focused self to agree to things without thinking about them. Even if someone gives me some time to make a decision, I have generally made it a split-second after the question/ proposition was brought up. I live quite heavily by the whims of my "gut." And I've generally never been disappointed by this. This is probably the cause of the [fragility](#fragile-daily-schedule) of my schedule XD. But ah whatever, such is life.

On another note, I have recently come to realise that teaching someone to cook is a harrowing experience. This has not been the case with teaching someone a concept of Computer Science or Mathematics, so I wonder if how one teaches is linked to how they learnt a subject. 

I learnt cooking in a fast-paced kitchen, with the loud clanking of utensils, shouting of instructions and proclamations for ingredients being the background to which I worked. So to deliberately slow down the kitchen, wait for the disciple to complete each individual step, and let them work at their pace is a foreign thing to me. 

I have to hold back every part of my body from stepping in and taking over, because I feel as if I could do it faster, and probably better. But at the same time, I know that this student specifically works well with slow practice and words of encouragement. I do this, because I look forward to seeing the accomplishment on their face, and feel happy that they have picked up another skill. I hope I'll eventually temper myself like Marco Pierre White did, someone who went from making Gordon Ramsay cry to teaching deliberately.  

Signing off,
Rajat
